Indian Corporate Law Q&A Assistant
Fine-tuning a Small LLM for Indian Corporate Law
This project demonstrates the process of creating a specialized Question-Answering model focused on Indian Corporate Law, specifically the Companies Act, 2013.
The goal is to build a helpful assistant for law students, paralegals, or small business owners seeking quick and reliable answers on regulations and compliance.

Project Overview
General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the deep, nuanced knowledge required in specialized legal domains.
This project addresses that gap by:
Generating a synthetic dataset of Indian Corporate Law Q&A pairs.
Fine-tuning a small, efficient LLM for domain-specific accuracy.
Demonstrating the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Use Case
The project focuses on the Indian Companies Act, 2013 â€” a core legal framework governing corporate law in India.
Accurate domain-specific answers are critical in legal contexts, where misinterpretation can lead to compliance risks.
